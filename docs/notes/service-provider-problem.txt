Problem
Services are dynamically added
Providers are statically added
User needs to choose a certain service and a certain provider
Service selection is done through a service relation

Solution: keep the provider an entity as well
In the controller, send the user's request through a proxy
The proxy picks a handler based on the Provider's handlerName attribute
The handler sends the response back to the proxy
The proxy sends the response to the controller

========================================

Problem
All services search must include the provider's name as well
Solution: make it a providers search directly
All services list must categorize the service into different providers
Solution: loop over the services in the View and for each service use getProvidersForService in the providers controller
