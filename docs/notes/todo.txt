Notes
- Handler uses Template method pattern
- HandlerFactory uses factory
- Relation (update, select, selectMax) uses Strategy pattern
- EntityBuilder uses Builder pattern
- The concept of "handlers" if factory

TODO
- Proxy pattern in front of authorized controller (?)
- Strategy pattern for choosing payment method
- Command pattern in UI choices/input
- Decorator pattern to accumulate the discounts
- Split response and handler response?
- Abstract factory with Handlers (?)
