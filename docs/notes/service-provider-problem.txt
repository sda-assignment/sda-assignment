Problem
Services are dynamically added
Providers are statically added
User needs to choose a certain service and a certain provider
Service selection is done through a service relation

Solution: keep the provider an entity as well
In the controller, send the user's request through a bus
The providers listen to this bus for their socket name
They send the response (will be the amount to deduce) back to the bus

========================================

Problem
All services search must include the provider's name as well
Solution: make it a providers search directly
All services list must categorize the service into different providers
Solution: use a join

========================================================
