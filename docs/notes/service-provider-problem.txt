Problem
Services are dynamically added
Providers are statically added
User needs to choose a certain service and a certain provider
Service selection is done through a service relation

Solution: keep the provider an entity as well
In the controller, send the user's request through a bus
The providers listen to this bus for their socket name
They send the response (will be the amount to deduce) back to the bus
There exists an overhead of having to know how to format the request in the handler

Alternative solution: make both services and providers statically
New services and providers are hard-coded
The service providers do not belong to our payments system (need to be a separate package)
But our system needs to know which service providers it deals with
Also how do we search?

The root of these problems is that handler functions can not be dynamically created

========================================

Problem
All services search must include the provider's name as well
Solution: make it a providers search directly
All services list must categorize the service into different providers
Solution: use a join
