Problems
- Join logic in the controllers
- Do we use aggregations to represent the relationships?
- Discounts? user has a list of discounts? A discount has a list of users?
- Keep it as it is

- Coupled save and load. Load needs to know the format of the saved stuff
- Not major

- A database may be required later
- Will we even need stuff in memory?
- How do we map the query result to the Entity object?
- Relation will not be generic
- Will create a Relation class for each entity that has its own operations. This performs the queries and maps
the result to the Entity object
